# Wiki-Main
A repository for detailing snippets of code, useful tutorials, and helpful papers for easy reference. It is aimed to be both an easy jumping off point for new students, and a reminder for extant students and staff.

Please put code snippets up as new files, and put a direct link in this readme for easy reference. A guide to formatting the readme can be found [HERE](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Code snippets should contain a MWE for preference.
